# Preschool Math Game - Quick PRD

Build a browser-based math game for ages 5-8 that makes math practice fun and emotionally supportive. Kids pick a cute animal companion and work through 10 adaptive math problems per session (addition, subtraction, counting, next/previous number, comparisons, patterns). The game adapts difficulty in real-time using a lookbehind algorithm (tracks last 10 problems) to challenge on good days and comfort on bad days. Visual progression shows the animal journeying toward a random treat (ice cream, chocolate, candy). Party popper celebrations reward excellent work, while gentle encouragement supports struggles. Bright pastel colors, cute transitions, and short emoji-rich messages keep the experience delightful.

Built with React and Bun, using localStorage for offline-first experience with persistent progress. Lightweight bundle optimized for older tablets/Chromebooks. Use emoji for animals (🐰🐻🦊) and source free cute assets in coherent style. Animation library (Framer Motion or React Spring) for smooth, playful transitions. State management via Context API or Zustand. No backend, no authentication, no user accounts - purely local state.

Out of scope: Shapes/geometry, sound/music, time-telling, money problems, parent dashboards, accessibility features, manual difficulty settings, social/multiplayer features, and mobile native apps. Future enhancements include progress tracking, audio, time/money problem types, and configurable session lengths.
